# Contributing to Atomist Open Source Projects

Have something you would like to contribute to this project? Awesome, and thanks for taking time to contribute! Here's what you need to know.


Is there an improvement to existing functionality or an entirely new feature you would like to see? Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the issue list as you might find out that you don't need to create one.

Did you know we have a [Slack community][slack]? This might be a great place to talk through your idea before starting. It allows you to see if anyone else is already working on something similar, having the same issue or to get feedback on your enhancement idea. Discussing things with the community first is likely to make the contribution process a better experience for yourself and those that are maintaining the projects.

[slack]: https://join.atomist.com/

If you do not find an open issue related to your contribution and discussions in the Slack community are positive, the next thing to do is to create an issue in the appropriate GitHub repository.


*   Before we can accept any code changes into the Atomist codebase, we need to get some of the legal stuff covered. This is pretty standard for open-source projects. We are using [cla-assisant.io](https://cla-assistant.io/) to track our CLA signatures. Please ensure you sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/atomist/rug). 
*   Be sure there is an open issue related to the contribution.
*   Code contributions should follow our [coding conventions](http://docs.atomist.com/reference-docs/rug-conventions/).
*   Commit messages should follow the [standard format](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and should include a [reference](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions) to the open issue they are addressing.
*   All code contributions should be submitted via a [pull request (PR) from a forked GitHub repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).
*   Your PR will be reviewed by an Atomist developer.



Please go through the checklist below before submitting. There's a chance it may have already been reported, or resolved.

* Check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of the project.
* Search the [atomist-community](https://join.atomist.com) Slack community for common questions and problems.
* Understand which repo the bug should be reported in.
* Scan the list of issues to see if the problem has previously been reported. If so, you may add a comment to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.


You went through the list above and it is still something you would like to report? Then, please provide us with as much of the context, by explaininig the problem and including any additional details that would help maintainers reproduce the problem. The more details you provide in the bug report, the better.

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide as much information as possible. Feel free to use the [bug report template](#bug-report-template) below if you like.

At a minimum include the following:

* Where did you find the bug? For example, did you encounter the bug using a button, the bot, or the CLI?
* What version are you using?
* What command were you using when it happened? (including params where applicable)
